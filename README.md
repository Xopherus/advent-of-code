# advent-of-code

My solutions to various Advent of Code programming puzzles. 

Every year I set my expectations high,
hoping to solve them all. 
Every year I end up flaming out a week or so in
because they just get more challenging
and I get pulled into other holiday responsibilities.
Nevertheless - it's a fun way to pass the time 
and keep some of my algorithm skills sharp.
